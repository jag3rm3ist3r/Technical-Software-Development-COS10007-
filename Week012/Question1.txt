a.	Class
	A class is a specification for an object that may be used to create as many
	objects as the programmer desires.
	It works similarly to a struct but it can have member functions.
b.	Object
	An object is the result of using a class definition it is an instance of
	that class just as a struct has a definition but you can create many structs
	from it's definition.
c.	Member function
	Member functions are functions that may be called from an object just like
	how a struct has many member data types.
d.	Data member
	Data members work just like a struct, but for objects; they are usually
	obfuscated behind a function.
e.	Access specifiers
	Access specifiers determine whether an object's
	data members/member functions can be accessed externally.
f.	Class definition
	A class definition is like a function definition and a struct definition
	jammed together. It's a definition just like a struct but it can have
	functions and some members can be obfuscated.
g.	Encapsuations
	Encapsulations a method of obfuscating protected members in a function that interacts with them.
h.	Inheritance
	Inheritance is the ability for an object to have parent objects that it inherits properties from.
