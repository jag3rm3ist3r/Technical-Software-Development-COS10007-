a.
A data structure is a way of organizing data so it can be accessed or stored
effectively such as an array or binary tree.


b.
Linear data structures are linked to each other in a chain in one or two
directions, whereas non-linear data structures will have all kinds of
relationships between elements in the data structure.


c.
Stacks:

push
b -> c -> d -> e -> NULL

a    b -> c -> d -> e -> NULL

a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> NULL

pop
a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> NULL

a    b -> c -> d -> e -> NULL

b -> c -> d -> e -> NULL


d.
Stacks are a type of linked list that is only interacted with from the head
of the list.
Linked lists are lists of elements that are organized by their relationships
with each other and linked by pointers.


e.
A stack can be used to store operations that have higher priority the later
they are created.
A stack can be used to store data without having to store much information about
the location of the data, as the head of the stack is all that is needed to
address it.
