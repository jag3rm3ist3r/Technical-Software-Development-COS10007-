Week 9 Question 1

The advantage of breaking down your source files into multiple chunks
(separate .c and .h files) is that you can recompile one chunk at a time and
reuse the chunks in other programs later.
You are also able to use ifdef/ifndef conditions to include different versions
of the file for different operating systems.
